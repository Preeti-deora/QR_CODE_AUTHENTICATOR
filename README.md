# QR Code Authentication: A Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approach

## Project Overview
This project aims to authenticate QR codes using both traditional machine learning (ML) models and deep learning (DL) techniques. The dataset consists of genuine and counterfeit QR codes, with handcrafted feature extraction techniques applied to enhance classification.

## Dataset and Preprocessing
### Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of two classes:
- **First Prints**: Original QR codes.
- **Second Prints**: Counterfeit QR codes.

#### Dataset Statistics:
- **Total First Prints:** 100
- **Total Second Prints:** 100
- **Average Mean Intensity (First Prints):** 121.61
- **Average Mean Intensity (Second Prints):** 105.16

### Preprocessing Steps
- **Grayscale Conversion**: QR codes are converted to grayscale to remove unnecessary color information.
- **Resizing**: Images are resized to **256×256** pixels for model compatibility.
- **Normalization**: Pixel values are scaled between 0 and 1.
- **Feature Extraction**: For the ML model, handcrafted features such as intensity distribution and edge detection are extracted.

## Feature Extraction
The project extracts handcrafted features using:
- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** for texture and shape analysis.
- **Sobel Filter** for edge detection, capturing edge mean and standard deviation.
- **Shannon Entropy** for texture analysis.

## Model Training & Evaluation
Both ML and CNN-based models are trained using extracted features and raw image data respectively.

### Machine Learning Model
- **Classifier Used**: Random Forest Classifier.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

#### Machine Learning Model Performance:
- **Accuracy:** 100%
- **Confusion Matrix:**
  ```
  [[21  0]
   [ 0 19]]
  ```
